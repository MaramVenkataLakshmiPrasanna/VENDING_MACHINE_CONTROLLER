# ​ Vending Machine Controller – UVM Verification Project

##  Overview  
This repository hosts the **Vending Machine Controller (VMC)** RTL design and its **functional verification environment**. The RTL, written in Verilog, supports up to **1024 programmable items** with dynamic configuration via an APB interface. The accompanying UVM-based testbench validates functionality, change calculation, and operational integrity across normal and corner cases.

For a quick demonstration of the VMC in action, you can explore the EDA Playground environment here:
